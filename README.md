# Overview of the report
Climate change and global warming is a predominant problem nowadays, in the north pole, polar ice caps are melting at a rate of almost 14% per decade. On top of that, over the past 30 years, the oldest and thickest ice in the north pole has declined by almost 95%. However, a lot of countries in the world are acting and making new policies to limit the emission of green house gas. In this paper, I would like to see if Toronto is actively attempting to fight against global warming.

The dataset I will be using is from City of Toronto Data Portal, it records the Energy consumption and Green House Gas emissions for different organizations in Toronto from 2011 - 2017, by analyzing them, I will be able to find out if the city of Toronto is fighting against Global Warming. I already have access to the data.
